# My Dev Bucket List

I think many of us have hopes and dreams we would like to achieve before we die. I thought it might be a good idea to write some of them down in a public domain, where others can see and inquire about my progress, and perhaps inspire others to do the same.

Some of these goals will follow divergent paths, so it's possible that two goals are diametrically opposed and will not both be achieved.

My goal is to modify and revise this list as time goes. We all know that circumstances can change, and plans need revisiting from time to time. My hope is to see my green (+) commits than red (-) commits as time goes on.

So in no particular order, here's my list:

### List

- [ ] Create an open source project that receives > 1k stars
- [ ] Give a talk at a conference
- [ ] Put a product of my own invention to market
- [ ] Put a product of my own invention to market that gets > 10,000 users
- [ ] Put a product of my own invention to market that gets > 100,000 users
- [ ] Put a product of my own invention to market that gets > 1,000,000 users
- [ ] Put a product of my own invention to market that people pay for
- [ ] Be the lead engineer for a team
- [ ] Be a CTO
- [ ] Start a small company, preferably by bootstrapping
- [ ] Hire my first employee for my company
